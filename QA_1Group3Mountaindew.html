            <h3>1. Deforestation: Compromises of a Growing World </h3>
            <p>Deforestation can also be seen as removal of forests leading to several imbalances ecologically and environmentally. What makes deforestation alarming is the immediate and long term effects it is bound to inflict if continued at the current pace.</p>
            
            
            <h3>2. Deforestation</h3>
            <p>Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forest land use such as arable land, urban use, logged area or wasteland.</p>
            
            
            <h3>3. Deforestation and Forest Degration</h3>
            <p>Deforestation is a particular concern in tropical rain forests because these forests are home to much of the worldâ€™s biodiversity. For example, in the Amazon around 17% of the forest has been lost in the last 50 years, mostly due to forest conversion for cattle ranching. Deforestation in this region is particularly rampant near more populated areas, roads and rivers, but even remote areas have been encroached upon when valuable mahogany, gold, and oil are discovered.</p>
